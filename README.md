# MediDaily: Online Pharmacy Management

## Overview

 The project focuses on the design and implementation of a database for an online and offline pharmaceutical store, MediDaily. With the increasing demand for healthcare goods and prescription drugs, MediDaily offers a subscription model to streamline the ordering of life-sustaining medications. The database aims to facilitate data visualization, analytical solutions, and efficient data storage with minimal duplication.

## Problem Setting

The healthcare industry has witnessed a surge in demand for over-the-counter medicines and prescription drugs due to factors such as the internet's prevalence and the COVID-19 pandemic. To address these evolving consumer needs, MediDaily offers convenient solutions for ordering medicines online or in-store, saving time, and providing a wider range of product choices. The project's goal is to create a comprehensive database to support both online and offline operations. This database will maintain automated digital records, track trends, and provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Problem Definition

In the context of MediDaily, the database must store essential information, including user details, product data, orders, subscriptions, reviews, shop and warehouse information, employee records, and supplier details. The project defines the database schema and relationships through conceptual models, which are further implemented in relational databases using MySQL and NoSQL databases.

## Results

### Key Results:
- Successfully designed and implemented a database to support both online and offline pharmacy operations.
- Implemented normalization to eliminate data redundancy.
- Executed the database in MySQL and MongoDB for different use cases.
- Demonstrated the ability to generate valuable insights and analytics for business decision-making.

## Impact of Project Outcome
